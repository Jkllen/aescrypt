Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the final stages of the project, I want to remind everyone to back up their files and ensure that all sensitive documents are properly encrypted before sharing. Data security remains our top priority, especially since we are handling client information that must remain confidential.

Please make sure to review the updated guidelines in the shared folder and verify that all communication is conducted through the approved secure channels. Once the final report is completed, send me an encrypted version only — do not transmit it in plain text.

Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. Let’s make sure this project ends as strongly as it began.

— Project Manager
